**Now it's your turn to write some R code!**

The following includes a list of exercises that you can complete on your
own.

We are going to use the `palmerpenguins` data set for the tasks ahead!

## Functions reference list

For reference, here is a list of some useful functions.

If you have trouble with any of these functions, try reading the
documentation with `?function_name`

Remember: all these functions take the **data** first.

-   `filter()`

    -   Subset rows using column values

-   `mutate()`

    -   Create and modify delete columns

-   `rename()`

    -   Rename columns

-   `select()`

    -   Subset columns using their names and types

-   `summarise()`; `summarize()`

    -   Summarise each group to fewer rows

-   `group_by()`; `ungroup()`

    -   Group by one or more variables

-   `arrange()`

    -   Arrange rows by column values

-   `count()`; `tally()`

    -   Count observations by group

-   `distinct()`

    -   Subset distinct/unique rows

-   `pull()`

    -   Extract a single column

-   `ifelse()`

    -   useful for coding of binary variables

-   `case_when()`

    -   useful for recoding (when `ifelse` is not enough)

-   `separate()`

    -   separate two variables by some separator

-   `pivot_wider()`

    -   turn data into wide format

-   `pivot_longer()`

    -   turn data into long format

## Task 1

Load the `tidyverse` and `janitor` packages.

> If `tidyverse` or `janitor` packages are not installed yet (it will
> say `[package] not found`). Your first task, is then to install them.
> Note: this might take you a little bit of time.

```{r}
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Task 2

Read in the already cleaned `palmerpenguins` data set using

-   `read_csv`
-   the following URL:
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv>

Assign the resulting data to `penguins`.

Then take a look a look at it using `glimpse`.

```{r}
penguins <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv")
penguins

```

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)

```

What kind of variables can you recognize?

*Response:*

## Task 3

Only keep the variables: `species`, `island` and `sex`.

```{r}

select(penguins, species, island,sex)

```

Only keep variables 2 to 4.

```{r}

select(penguins, 2:4)

```

Remove the column `year`.

```{r}

select(penguins, -year)

```

Only include columns that contain "mm" in the variable name.

```{r}

select(penguins, contains("mm"))

```

## Task 4

Rename `island` to `location`.

```{r}

pg <- rename(penguins, location=island)
pg

```

## Task 5

Filter the data so that `species` only includes `Chinstrap`.

```{r}

filter(penguins, species == "Chinstrap")

```

Filter the data so that `species` only includes `Chinstrap` or `Gentoo`.

```{r}

filter(penguins, species=="Chinstrap" | species=="Gentoo")

```

Filter the data so it includes only penguins that are `male` *and* of
the species `Adelie`.

```{r}

filter(penguins, sex=="male" & species=="Adelie")

```

## Task 6

Create three new variables that calculates `bill_length_mm` and
`bill_depth_mm` and `flipper_length_mm` from millimeter to centimeter.

Tip: divide the length value by 10.

```{r}
pg <- group_by(penguins, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm)
mutate(pg, convertbl_mm_tocm= bill_length_mm/10, convertbd_mm_tocm= bill_depth_mm/10, convertfl_mm_tocm= flipper_length_mm/10)

```

Create a new variable called `bill_depth_cat` which has two values:

-   Everything above a bill depth of 18mm and 18mm itself is "high"
-   Everything below a bill depth of 18mm is "low"

```{r}

pg2 <- mutate(penguins, bill_depth_cat = ifelse(bill_depth_mm>18, "high", "low"))
select(pg2, bill_depth_mm, bill_depth_cat)

```

Create a new variable called `species_short`.

-   `Adelie` should become `A`
-   `Chinstrap` should become `C`
-   `Gentoo` should become `G`

```{r}

pg3 <- mutate(penguins, species_short = 
        case_when(
          species =="Adelie" ~ "A",
          species =="Chinstrap" ~ "C",
          species == "Gentoo" ~ "G"
        ))
select(pg3, species, species_short)

```

## Task 7

Calculate the average `body_mass_g` per `island`.

```{r}

groupby_island <- group_by(penguins, island)
summarise(groupby_island, avg_bmg=mean(body_mass_g, na.rm=T))

```

If you haven't done so already, try using the `%>%` operator to do this.

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarise(avg_bmg = mean(body_mass_g , na.rm = T))

```

## Task 8

Use the pipe operator (`%>%`) to do all the operations below.

1.  Filter the `penguins` data so that it only includes `Chinstrap` or
    `Adelie`.
2.  Rename `sex` to `observed_sex`
3.  Only keep the variables `species`, `observed_sex`, `bill_length_mm`
    and `bill_depth_mm`
4.  Calculate the ratio between `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm`
5.  Sort the data by the highest ratio

Try to create the pipe step by step and execute code as you go to see if
it works.

Once you are done, assign the data to `new_penguins`.

```{r}
new_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm) %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap" | species == "Adelie") %>% 
  mutate(ratio = bill_length_mm/bill_depth_mm) %>% 
  rename(observed_sex = sex) %>%
  arrange(desc(ratio))
  
new_penguins


```

Calculate the average ratio by `species` and `sex`, again using pipes.

```{r}
new_penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, observed_sex) %>% 
  mutate(avg_ratio = mean(ratio, na.rm = T)) 


```

## Task 9

Count the number of penguins by island and species.

```{r}

count(penguins, island, species, sort = T)

```

## Task 10

Below is a dataset that needs some cleaning.

Use the skills that you have learned so far to turn the data into a tidy
dataset.

```{r}
animal_friends <- tibble(
  Names = c("Francis", "Catniss", "Theodor", "Eugenia"),
  TheAnimals = c("Dog", "Cat", "Hamster", "Rabbit"),
  Sex = c("m", "f", "m", "f"),
  a_opterr = c("me", "me", "me", "me"),
  `Age/Adopted/Condition` = c("8/2020/Very Good", "13/2019/Wild", "1/2021/Fair", "2/2020/Good")    
) 
```

Start here:

```{r}

friends_clean <- separate(animal_friends, 'Age/Adopted/Condition', sep = " \\/", into = c("Age/Adopted/Condition", "Age","Adopt","Condit"))

```


If you are done, turn the final data into long format.

```{r}

friends_clean

```
